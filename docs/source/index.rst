    ``pocoMC`` is a Python package for fast Bayesian posterior and model evidence estimation. It leverages 
    the Preconditioned Monte Carlo (PMC) algorithm, offering significant speed improvements over 
    traditional methods like MCMC and Nested Sampling. Ideal for large-scale scientific problems 
    with expensive likelihood evaluations, non-linear correlations, and multimodality, ``pocoMC`` 
    provides efficient and scalable posterior sampling and model evidence estimation. Widely used 
    in cosmology and astronomy, ``pocoMC`` is user-friendly, flexible, and actively maintained.

.. admonition:: Where to start?
    :class: tip

    üñ• A good place to get started is with the :doc:`install` and then the
    :doc:`quickstart` guide. If you are not familiar with Bayesian inference
    have a look at the :doc:`background`.

    üìñ For more details, check out the :doc:`likelihood` through :doc:`blobs` information, 
    as well as the :doc:`fitting` and :doc:`model_comparison` tutorials.

    üí° If you're running into problems getting ``pocoMC`` to do what you want, first
    check out the :doc:`faq` page, for some general tips and tricks.

    üêõ If :doc:`faq` doesn't solve your problems, or if you find bugs,
    then head on over to the `GitHub issues page <https://github.com/minaskar/pocomc/issues>`_.

    üëà Check out the sidebar to find the full table of contents.
